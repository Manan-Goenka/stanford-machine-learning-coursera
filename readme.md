# Machine Learning Coursera

My work for the machine learning coursera course from Stanford University, where I learned machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.

Topics covered include computer vision, text processing (spam recognition, web search), and medical informatics. I recieved a certificate of completion.
